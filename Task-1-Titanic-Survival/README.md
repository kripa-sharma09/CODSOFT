# 🛳 Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

This is Task 1 of my Data Science Internship at *CodSoft*.

I developed a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using features such as gender, age, class, and fare.

## 📌 Key Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values and encoded categorical variables)
- Visualized survival trends by gender, age, and class
- Trained a *Random Forest Classifier*
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics
- Analyzed feature importance to see what most influenced survival

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Results
- *Model Accuracy*:  0.8044692737430168

- *Top Features*: Fare, Sex, Age, Pclass
